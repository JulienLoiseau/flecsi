      Jonas is a computational scientist with a background in
      computational and nuclear astrophysics. His research has been
      focused on the origin of heavy elements like silver, gold, and
      uranium. He has developed a sophisticated nuclear reaction network
      to simulate how such elements and thousands of other isotopes are
      created in various astrophysical scenarios, such as the merger of
      two neutron stars or the explosion of a massive star. Jonas also
      has extensive experience with developing highly optimized code for
      GPUs. He is working on implementing physics applications on top of
      the FleCSI framework.

      Jonathan has a multidisciplinary background in observational solar
      physics, turbulence theory, astrophysical simulation, the oil and
      gas industry, and programming models for exascale computing.  He
      has published papers evaluating mesoscale ocean large-eddy
      simulation models by employing spectral transfer analysis,
      determining the limits of fractal extrapolation of the mean solar
      magnetic flux, investigating the small scale dynamo in convective,
      radiative magnetohydrodynamics, and several papers on using
      mathematical closures for large eddy simulations.

      Jonathan has been involved in using Legion task-based parallelism
      for exascale computing both in proxy applications and in the
      development of FleCSI.
