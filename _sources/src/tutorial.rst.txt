Tutorial
========

This tutorial attempts to give a basic introduction to the design
philosophy and structure of the FleCSI programming system. Each
subdirectory contains example codes that can be compiled with CMake.
Details on how to build the tutorials are given below.

.. attention::

  This tutorial is primarily designed as an introduction for application
  developers, i.e., we do not go into the details of designing or
  implementing the specialization layer, and the discussion of core
  FleCSI features is limited to the high-level execution and data
  interfaces.

  Because a specialization layer is necessary to use FleCSI, we have
  provided a simple mesh interface as part of the tutorial. Users who
  are interested in the basic structure of a mesh_topology
  specialization are encouraged to examine the source code in the
  *specialization* subdirectory of this tutorial (The complete source
  code is in the *flecsi/tutorial/specialization* subdirectory of the
  main project.)

Requirements
************

This tutorial assumes that you have successfully installed FleCSI
somewhere on your system. Instructions for different install methods are
available here: :ref:`build`

Using the Docker Container
**************************

The tutorial is also available as a Docker container. This simplifies
getting and installing FleCSI and its dependencies.

.. include:: install_docker.rst

Pulling the Image
+++++++++++++++++

To pull the tutorial image, do:

.. code-block:: console

  $ docker pull laristra/flecsi-tutorial:latest

This will download the image to your machine. Once the pull is complete,
you can run the image like:

.. code-block:: console

  $ docker run -it --shm-size=512m -h tutorialhost -u flecsi laristra/flecsi-tutorial:latest

This will place you into a bash prompt, from which you can build and run
the tutorial examples. The tutorials are in the *top-level* directory in
the Docker container.

**Note:** You can also pull a Docker image for a specific runtime, e.g.,
mpi or legion. The default image *latest* is built against the Legion
backend. To pull the MPI backend image do:

.. code-block:: console

  $ docker pull laristra/flecsi-tutorial:mpi

Tutorial Examples
*****************

The tutorial examples are designed to guide the reader through basic to
more advanced FleCSI concepts.
